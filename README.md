# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal of this project is to practice working with:
- Basic HTML structure
- Creating and linking multiple pages
- Organising files and folders
- Using relative links
- Git and GitHub basics (creating repos, cloning, commits, pushes)

Once completed, this project will demonstrate:
- My ability to build a multi-page HTML website
- My understanding of folder structure and relative paths
- My confidence using Git and GitHub to manage a real project
